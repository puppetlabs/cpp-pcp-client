This repository is archived and Perforce will no longer be updating this repository. For more information, see [this Puppet blog post](https://www.puppet.com/blog/open-source-puppet-updates-2025).

cpp-pcp-client is a C++ client library for the [PCP protocol][specs]. It includes a
collection of abstractions which can be used to initiate connections to a PCP
broker, wrapping the PCP message format and performing schema validation for
message bodies.

cpp-pcp-client implements PCP by layering it upon WebSocket; it uses
[WebSocket++][websocket++] for that.

A tutorial on how to create a PCP agent / controller pair with cpp-pcp-client is
[here][tutorial].

### Important Data Structures

Before we start to look at creating connections and sending/receiving messages, it
is important to look at some of the data structures used by cpp-pcp-client.

__leatherman::json_container::JsonContainer__

The [JsonContainer][json_container] class is used frequently by the
cpp-pcp-client library as a simplified abstraction around complex JSON
c++ libraries.

__ParsedChunks__

The _Parsed_Chunks_ struct is a simplification of a parsed PCP message. It allows
for direct access of a message's Envelope, Data and Debug chunks as JsonContainer
or string objects.

The ParsedChunks struct is defined as:

```
    struct ParsedChunks {
        // Envelope
        JsonContainer envelope;

        // Data
        bool got_data;
        ContentType data_type;
        JsonContainer data;
        std::string binary_data;

        // Debug
        std::vector<JsonContainer> debug;
    }
```

<a name="connections"/>
### Creating Connections

The first step to interacting with a PCP broker is creating a connection. To
achieve this we must first create an instance of the Connector object.

The constructor of the Connector class is defined as:

```
    Connector(std::string broker_ws_uri,
              std::string client_type,
              std::string ca_crt_path,
              std::string client_crt_path,
              std::string client_key_path,
              std::string client_crl_path,
              std::string proxy,
              long ws_connection_timeout_ms = 5000,
              uint32_t association_timeout_s = 15,
              uint32_t association_request_ttl_s = 10,
              uint32_t pong_timeouts_before_retry = 3,
              long ws_pong_timeout_ms = 30000);
```

The parameters are described as:

 - client_type - The PCP client type. The only value that you cannot use is "server",
 which is reserved for PCP brokers (please refer to the URI section in the
 [PCP specifications][specs]).
 - broker_ws_uri - The WebSocket URL of the PCP broker. For example, _wss://localhost:8142/pcp/_.
 - ca_crt_path - The path to your CA certificate file.
 - client_crt_path - The path to a client certificate file generated by your CA.
 - client_key_path - The path to a client public key file generated by you CA.
 - client_crl_path - The path to a certificate revocation list file.
 - proxy - The proxy URI you wish to connect to PCP-broker over. ex: `http://localhost:3128`
 - ws_connection_timeout_ms - The timeout for initiating the WebSocket handshake (in milliseconds). Defaults to 5000 ms.
 - association_timeout_s - The timeout for the completion of the PCP Association. Defaults to 3 s.
 - association_request_ttl_s - The TTL of the PCP Association Request (in seconds). Defaults to 10 s.

This means that you can instantiate a Connector object as follows:

```
    Connector connector { "wss://localhost:8142/pcp/", 
                          "controller",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/ca/ca_crt.pem",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/client_crt.pem",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/public_keys/client_key.pem",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/crl.pem",
                          "", // no proxy
                          4000,  // WebSocket connection timeout
                          5 };   // PCP Association timeout
```

An alternate constructor for Connector also exists that takes a list of brokers, as in:

```
    Connector connector { {"wss://broker1.example.com:8142/pcp/", "wss://broker2.example.com:8142/pcp/"},
                          "controller",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/ca/ca_crt.pem",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/client_crt.pem",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/public_keys/client_key.pem",
                          "/etc/puppet/ssl/crl.pem",
                          "", // no proxy
                          4000,  // WebSocket connection timeout
                          5 };   // PCP Association timeout
```

When multiple brokers are specified, if one is unavailable it will attempt to connect to
another in the list, rotating through them with a delay between repeated attempts.

When you have created a Connector object you are ready to connect. To do that,
you'll use Connector's `connect` that will establish the WebSocket connection
and perform the PCP Association with the broker. Such method is defined as:

```
    void connect(int max_connect_attempts = 0) throws (connection_config_error,
                                                       connection_fatal_error,
                                                       connection_association_error,
                                                       connection_association_response_failure)
```

The parameters are described as:

 - max_connect_attempts - The amount of times the Connector will try and establish
 a connection to the PCP broker if a problem occurs. It will try to connect
 indefinately when set to 0. Defaults to 0.

The connect method can throw the following exceptions:

```
    class connection_config_error : public connection_error
```

This exception will be thrown if a Connector is misconfigured. Misconfiguration
includes specifying an invalid broker WebSocket URL or a path to a file that
doesn't exist. Note that, if this exception has been thrown, no attempt at
creating a network connection has yet been made.

```
    class connection_fatal_error : public connection_error
```

This exception wil be thrown if the connection cannot be established after the
Connector has tried _max_connect_attempts_ times.

```
    class connection_association_error : public connection_error
```

This exception wil be thrown in case of a problem during the PCP Association:
 - an invalid message is received;
 - a PCP Error message is received;
 - a TTL Expired message is received;
 - the `association_timeout_s` timeout expires.

```
    class connection_association_response_error : public connection_error
```

This exception wil be thrown after a PCP Asssociate Session response
indicating a failure.

A connection can be established as follows:

```
    try {
        connector.connect(5);
    } catch (connection_config_error e) {
        ...
    } catch (connection_fatal_error) {
        ...
    }
```

If no exceptions are thrown it means that a connection has been sucessfuly
established. You can check on the status of a connection with the Connector's
isConnected method.

The isConnected method is defined as:

```
    bool isConnected()
```

And it can be used as follows:

```
    if (connector.isConnected()) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
```

By default a connection is non persistent. For instance, in case WebSocket is
used as the underlying transport layer, ping messages must be sent periodically
to keep the connection alive. Also, the connection may drop due to communication
errors.  You can enable connection persistence by starting the Monitoring Task
with the _monitorConnection_ method; it will periodically check the state of the
underlying connection and send keepalive messages to the broker. In case the
connection is not open, it will attempt to re-establish it.

_monitorConnection_ is defined as:

```
    void monitorConnection(int max_connect_attempts = 0
                          const uint32_t connection_check_interval_s = 15)
```

The parameters are described as:

- max_connect_attemps - The number of times the Connector will try to reconnect
 a connection to the PCP broker if a problem occurs. It will try to connect
 indefinately when set to 0. Defaults to 0;
- connection_check_interval_s - The time interval between ping messages.
 Defaults to 15 s.

Note that if the Connector fails to re-establish the connection after the
specified number of attempts, a _connection_fatal_error_ will be thrown.
Also, a possible connection_association_response_error will be propagated
(see the description of the _connect_ method above).

Calling _monitorConnection_ will block the execution thread as the Monitoring
Task will not be executed on a separate thread. On the other hand, the caller
can safely execute _monitorConnection_ on a separate thread since the function
returns once the _Connector_ destructor is invoked.

In alternative, to keep alive the connection, you can use the non-blocking
_startMonitoring_; it will start the Monitoring Task in a separate thread. Its
signature is equivalent to the _monitorConnection_ one:

```
    void monitorConnection(int max_connect_attempts = 0,
                           const uint32_t connection_check_interval_s = 15)
```

To stop the Monitoring Task spawned by _startMonitoring_ you call
_stopMonitoring_:

```
    void stopMonitoring()
```

Note that _stopMonitoring_ may throw an exception. In fact, when using
_startMonitoring_, if a _connection_fatal_error_ or
_connection_association_response_error_ exception is thrown, the Monitoring Task
thread will catch and store such exception; it will be then re-thrown by a
subsequent call to _stopMonitoring_.

### Message Schemas and Callbacks

Every message sent over the PCP broker has to specify a value for the _data_schema_
field in the message envelope. These data schema's determine how a message's data
section is validated. To process messages received from a PCP broker you must
first create a schema object for a specific _data_schema_ value.

The constructor for the Schema class is defined as:

```
    Schema(std::string name, ContentType content_type)
```

The parameters are described as:

 - name - The name of the schema. This should be the same as the value found in
 a message's data_schema field.
 - content_type - Defines the content type of the schema. Valid options are
 ContentType::Binary and ContentType::Json

A Schema object can be created as follows:

```
    Schema cnc_request_schema { "cnc_request", ContentType::Json};
```

You can now start to add constraints to the Schema. Consider the following JSON-schema:

```
  {
    "title": "cnc_request",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "module": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "string"
      },
    },
    "required": ["module"]
  }
```
You can reproduce its constraints by using the addConstraint method which
is defined as follows:

```
    void addConstraint(std::string field, TypeConstraint type, bool required)
```

The parameters are described as follows:

 - field - The name of the field you wish to add the constraint to.
 - type - The type constraint to put on the field. Valid types are TypeConstraint::Bool,
 TypeConstraint::Int, TypeConstraint::Bool, TypeConstraint::Double, TypeConstraint::Array,
 TypeConstraint::Object, TypeConstraint::Null and TypeConstraint::Any
 - required - Specify whether the field is required to be present or not. If not specified
 it will default to false.

```
    cnc_request_schema.addConstraint("module", TypeConstraint::String, true);
    cnc_request_schema.addConstraint("action", TypeConstraint::String);
```

With a schema defined we can now start to process messages of that type by registering
message specific callbacks. This is done with the Connector's registerMessageCallback
method which is defined as follows:

```
    void registerMessageCallback(const Schema& schema, MessageCallback callback)
```

The parameters are described as follows:

 - schema - A previously created schema object
 - callback - A callback function with the signature void(const ParsedChunks& msg_content)

For example:

```
    void cnc_requestCallback(const ParsedChunks& msg_content) {
      std::cout << "Message envelope: " << msg_content.envelope.toString() << std::endl;

      if (msg_content.has_data()) {
        if (msg_content.data_type == ContentType::Json) {
          std::cout << "Content Type: JSON" << std::endl;
          std::cout << msg_content.data.toString() << std::endl;
        } else {
          std::cout << "Content Type: Binary" << std::endl;
          std::cout << msg_content.binary_data << std::endl;
        }
      }

      for (const auto& debug_chunk : msg_content) {
        std::cout << "Data Chunk: " << debug_chunk << std::endl;
      }
    }

    ...
    connector.registerMessageCallback(cnc_request_schema, cnc_requestCallback);
```

Now that the callback has been regsitered, every time a message is received where
the data_schema field is _cnc_request_, the content of the Data chunk will be
validated against the schema and if it passes, the above defined function will be called.
If a message is received which doesn't have a registered data_schema the message
will be ignored.

Using this method of registering schema/callback pairs we can handle each message
in a unique manner,

```
    connector.registerMessageCallback(cnc_request_schema, cnc_requestCallback);
    connector.registerMessageCallback(puppet_request_schema, puppet_requestCallback);
    connector.registerMessageCallback(puppet_db_request_schema, puppet_db_requestCallback);
```

or you can assign one callback to a lot of different schemas,

```
    connector.registerMessageCallback(schema_1, genericCallback);
    ...
    connector.registerMessageCallback(schema_n, genericCallback);
    connector.registerMessageCallback(schema_n1, genericCallback);
```

<a name="sending_messages"/>
### Sending Messages

Once you have established a connection to the PCP broker you can send messages
using the _send_ method. There are two main overloads for this function that
are defined as (please check connector.hpp for the other overloads):

```
    void send(std::vector<std::string> targets,
              std::string data_schema,
              unsigned int timeout,
              JsonContainer data_json,
              std::vector<JsonContainer> debug = std::vector<JsonContainer> {})
                        throws (connection_processing_error, connection_not_init_error)
```

With the parameters are described as follows:

 - targets - A vector of the destinations the message will be sent to
 - data_schema - The Schema that identifies the message type
 - timeout - Duration the message will be valid on the fabric, in seconds
 - data_json - A JsonContainer representing the data chunk of the message
 - debug - A vector of strings representing the debug chunks of the message (defaults to empty)


```
    std::string send(std::vector<std::string> targets,
                     std::string data_schema,
                     unsigned int timeout,
                     bool destination_report,
                     std::string data_binary,
                     std::vector<JsonContainer> debug = std::vector<JsonContainer> {})
                              throws (connection_processing_error, connection_not_init_error)

```

The above overload returns the ID of the sent message and accepts the following
parameters:

 - targets - A vector of the destinations the message will be sent to
 - data_schema - The Schema that identifies the message type
 - timeout - Duration the message will be valid on the fabric, in seconds
 - destination_report - A boolean indicating whether or not requesting a destination report
 - data_binary - A string representing the data chunk of the message
 - debug - A vector of strings representing the debug chunks of the message (defaults to empty)

The _send_ methods can throw the following exceptions:

```
    class connection_processing_error : public connection_error
```

This exception is thrown when an error occurs during at the underlying WebSocket
layer.

```
    class connection_not_init_error : public connection_error
```

This exception is thrown when trying to send a message when there is no active
connection to the broker.

Example usage:

```
    JsonContainer data {};
    data.set<std::string>("foo", "bar");
    try {
      auto id = connector.send({"pcp://*/potato"}, "potato_schema", 42, data);
      std::cout << "Sent potato message to all potato clients, with ID=" << id << std::endl;
    } catch (connection_not_init_error e) {
      std::cout << "Cannot send message without being connected to the broker" << std::endl;
    } catch (connection_processing_error e) {
      std::cout << "An error occured at the WebSocket layer: " << e.what() << std::endl;
   }
```

<a name="validation"/>
### Data Validation

As mentioned in the [Message Schemas and Callbacks](#receiving_messages), messages
received from the PCP broker will be matched against a Schema that you defined.
The Connector object achieves this functionality by using an instance of the Validator
class. It is possible to instantiate your own instance of the Validator class and
use schema's to validate other, non message, data structures.

The Validator is limited to a no-args constructor:

```
    Validator()
```

You can register a Schema by using the _registerSchema_ method, defined as:

```
    void registerSchema(const Schema& schema) throws (schema_redefinition_error)
```

The parameters are described as follows:

 - schema - A schema object that desribes a set of constraints.

When a Schema has been registered you can use the _validate_ method to validate
a JsonContainer object. The _validate_ method is defined as follows:

```
    void validate(JsonContainer& data, std::string schema_name) const throws (validation_error)
```

The parameters are described as follows:

 - data - A JsonContainer you want to validate.
 - schema_name - The name of the schema you want to validate against.

Example usage:

```
    Validator validator {};
    Schema s {"test-schema", ContentType::Json };
    s.addConstraint("foo", TypeConstraint::Int);
    validator.registerSchema(s);

    JsonContainer d {};
    d.set<int>("foo", 42);

    try {
      Validator.validate(d, "test-schema");
    } catch (validation_error) {
      std::cout << "Validation failed" << std::endl;
    }
```
